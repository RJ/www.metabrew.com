title: About RJ
---

My blog covers technical topics, but I promise I'm a well-rounded human with varied interests. I really like cooking. I'm married, with two young children and a cat. Lived in London until just a few years ago, now I live in Winchester and come to London from time to time.

            In 2008-2009 I <a href="/article/a-million-user-comet-application-with-mochiweb-part-1">wrote</a> about building a 1 million user "comet" (ie http streaming, pre-websockets) system, in Erlang.
            Although a fairly niche topic, I enjoyed hearing how it inspired people to learn Erlang for years afterwards.

            Music and media should be accessed by means of <i>content resolution</i>: matching metadata to local or remote sources. Embodied by <a href="http://www.playdar.org/">Playdar</a>.
            I built working implementations in both <a href="/article/rewriting-playdar-c-to-erlang-massive-savings">Erlang and C++</a>.

Recommendations, personalised radio, stats galore. Great fun, great team. Audioscrobbler, upon which Last.fm was built, started life as my university dissertation.

            <a href="/article/how-we-use-irc-at-lastfm">IRCCat</a> remains useful to this day. <a href="/article/libketama-consistent-hashing-algo-memcached-clients">libketama</a> (consistent hashing lib) is probably still in production in various places.
            I do a fair bit of poking <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>. I've done some talks and presentations, but mostly back before
            talk videos were routinely made and uploaded.
            Also I guess, a whole bunch of temporary or nasty hacks. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/RJ/doorbird-mdns-vlan-subnet-bridge">more recent</a> one that fixes a DNS resolution bug in Doorbird.
