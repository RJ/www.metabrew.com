    <h3>Hello</h3>

    I live in the UK. I'm old enough to know what it sounds like when a <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0">modem screams</a>.
    I founded
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040416081906/http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/RJ">Audioscrobbler</a>
    which evolved into <a href="https://last.fm">Last.fm</a>. Spent some time building
    <a href="https://www.playdar.org">a music content resolver</a>, in the golden years before
    the garden walls went up.
    Learned a lot of <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> writing the
    <a href="https://www.irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a> backend, and <a
        href="/article/a-million-user-comet-application-with-mochiweb-part-1">wrote
        about how I connected a million
        clients</a> to an erlang server, back when that was impressive.
    Occasional consultant.
    I'm currently dabbling in some <a href="/tag/gamedev/">gamedev</a> in Rust.
