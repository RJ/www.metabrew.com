I have dragged my blog, kicking and screaming, into the era of media-queries and responsive CSS. So now it's readable on a variety of screen sizes. My first post was roughly the same year the iPhone 3G came out I think, and the mobile web wasn't really a big deal back then. 

I imported ancient Disqus comments into github issue comments, and am giving [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) a try for comments, since it was the least hassle to set up.

In my limited free time, I am learning Rust ‚Äì specifically because I want to target WASM to build a simple multiplayer game that runs in the browser. Using UDP, via WebRTC hacks. With excellent rollback-netcode for responsive competitive play.. So not really that simple I guess ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
